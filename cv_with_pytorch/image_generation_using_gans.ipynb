    "- one of the most important breakthroughs in deep learning allowing computers to generate new data such as new images\n",
    "- objective of GANs is to synthesize new data that has same distribution as its training set.  \n",
    "- considered to be unsupervised learning algorithm since no label is required.  But extensions are available that can be used in supervised domains"

    "## GANs Introduction\n",
    "- GAN architecture composed of two terms: __generator__ and __discriminator__\n",
    "- First we should have a reasonable sample of images of an object\n",
    "- A generative network (generator) learns representation from a sample of images and then generates images similar to the sample of images.  \n",
    "- A discriminator network looks at the images generated by the generator network and original sample of images and classifies images as original ones or generated fake ones.  \n",
    "- The term advesarial in GAN represents the opposite nature of the two networks, __generator network__ which generates images to fool the __discriminator network__ and a __discriminator network__ that classfies each image by saying whether the image is real or fake.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A generator networks generates images from random noise as input.  A discriminator network looks at the images generated by the generator and compares them with real data (sample of images provided) to specify whether the generated image is fake or not.  The generator tries to generate as many realistic images as possible, while the discriminator tries to detect which of the images that are generated by the generator is fake.  Hence, generator learns to generate as many realistic images as possible by learning what the discriminator looks at to identify whether the image is real or fake.  \n",
    "- Generator and discriminator is trained alternately.  Hence its like a police and thief game: where generator is a thief trying to generate fake data and discriminator is police trying to identify the available data as real or fake.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in training GANs\n",
    "1. Train the generator (not the discriminator) to generate images such that the discriminator classifies the images as real\n",
    "2. Train the discriminator (not the generator) to classify the images that the generator generates as fake.  \n",
    "3. Repeat the process until an equilibrium is achieved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In preceding scenario, when the discriminator can detect generated images really well, the loss corresponding to the generator is much higher when compared to the loss corresponding to the discriminator\n",
    "- Thus, gradients adjust in such a way that the generator would have a loss.  But it would tip the discriminator loss to a higher side.  In next iteration, gradients adjust so that discriminator loss is lower.  That way, generator and discriminator keep getting trained until a point where the generator generates realistic images and the discriminator cannot distinguish between a real or generated image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Lets use MNIST dataset and generate fake data corresponding to this dataset"
